# 🎄 Advent of Code

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** solutions!  
Each day, I’ll be solving the puzzles using different programming languages — exploring new syntax, paradigms, and problem-solving techniques.

## 🧠 About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) is an annual set of programming puzzles released daily from **December 1st to 25th**.  
Each puzzle includes two parts, increasing in difficulty, and focuses on algorithmic thinking, data structures, and creative coding.

---

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
Each folder corresponds to a day of the challenge.

You’ll find:
- `input.txt` → my personal input data (from the AoC website)  
- `part1` / `part2` → solutions for each part of the puzzle  
- the file extension shows which **language** I used for that day

## 🚀 Progress Tracker

**AoC 2024**

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 | Language(s) Used | Notes |
|-----|---------|---------|------------------|--------|
| 01 | ✅ | ✅ | C# | Absolute difference puzzle |
| 02 | 🔲 | 🔲 | C++ | TBD |
| 03 | 🔲 | 🔲 | Python(?) | - |
| … |  |  |  |  |

(*✅ = solved, 🔲 = pending*)

---

## 🧩 Goals
- Practice **problem-solving** and algorithm design.  
- Get hands-on experience with **multiple programming languages**.  
- Learn and document different approaches to the same problem.

---

## ⚙️ Languages I’ll Use
I plan to experiment with a variety of languages, including:
- 🐍 **Python**
- 💻 **C#**
- 🧠 **C++**
- ☕ **Java**
- 🦀 **Rust**
- 💎 **Ruby**
- 🌐 **JavaScript / TypeScript**

Each day’s folder will clearly show which language I used.

## 🏁 How to Run
Depending on the language, you can run each solution as follows:

| Language | Command |
|-----------|----------|
| **Python** | `python3 part1.py` |
| **C#** | `dotnet run` *(inside project folder)* |
| **C++** | `g++ part1.cpp -o part1 && ./part1` |
| **Java** | `javac Main.java && java Main` |
| **Rust** | `cargo run` |
| **JavaScript** | `node part1.js` |
